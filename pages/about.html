					<h3 class="title">Danish Films: From comedy, Noir to Drama and Action</h3>
					<p class="text">Danish cinema has been operating for many decades, since the late 19th century. Originally, productions were revolved around comedies, released nationally, the rise of erotic films became a popular export for the country and thus increased the industries reputation.
						During the early 20th century, silent full-length feature films, where a success internationally and developed the notoriety of actress Asta Nielsen. From the seventies the development of the Danish Film institution broadened the scope of film production. State subsidies were offered to particular movie projects, which created a revival of Danish films. Since then, there has been changes to cinema from “Dogma” filmmaking, to see filmmakers creating movies in a more true and simplistic manner.
						Emerging into the 21st century, Danish film saw greater international success with directors such as Lars von Trier, Nicolai Winding Refn, Susanne Bier, Thomas Vinterberg, Nikolaj Arcel and Martin Zandvliet winning Oscars and legitimising the film industry.
